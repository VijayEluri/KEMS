= To do =

- Change problem runner to be used by C1 Strategy

- Instructions on how to run inside Eclipse
 run ProverInterface.java

- Make a new kems.zip with all that is needed (and only that)
 - how to store this at github?

- Minimize changes to several classes when a strategy is added
 - Currently we have to change:
  - ProverConfigurator
   - add the class name to one of the *_STRATEGY_NAMES constants as well as references in methods, depending on the strategy
  - RuleStructureMap
   - add an association in the constructor
  


= Done =

- Point in home page to git repository (6/10/09)
