KEMS Prover Scripts 


You must set JAVA_HOME if it is not set. For example:

 export JAVA_HOME=/mnt/hda8/java/j2sdk1.4.2_04
 
The JDK used must be the same used by the KEMS project.

build.xml describes actions for Ant

The jars used were generated by different projects:
 JFlex.jar - by the JFlex lexer
 java_cup.jar - Java CUP parser
