# symptoms/situations are consistent
# the health professional answers a questionnaire
# where we can answer yes/no/don't know for each condition
# "yes" adds "T Ci" to the database
# "no" adds "T !Ci" to the database
# "don't know"/"have no information" does not add nothing to
# the database
# Therefore, we cannot have, for instance, T A1 and T !A1
T @A1
T @A2
T @R1
T @R2
T @D1
T @D2
# If it is true that there is a "contra-indicacao" to normal birth

# If A2 is true, we have a "contra-indicacao" to normal birth

# If R1 is true, we can still have a normal birth, but we can also
# have a C-section

# If we don't have any absolute or relative "contra-indicacao" to normal birth,
# then we can have a normal birth and a C-section is not justified
